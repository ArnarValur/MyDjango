My Django CMS - The idea sprung from a tutorial I was playing with, which was an integration tutorial between Django, GraphQL and Vue.js. Then I thought I could use Django to create a small website for myself, then I thought I'd use Vue.js, and play with Tailwind and Flowbite, but my thoughts didn't stop there!<br>
Now I want to create a small intependent API-based CMS, with Django as the foundation and GraphQL that handles APIs. 
This project is just a "practice project" of mine to develop my coding and project management skills. 

ps. I'm contantly learning and growing, feel free to throw me feedbacks. :)
